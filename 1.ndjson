Over the years, he became so ignorant to the realities of Chinaâ\x80\x99s plight that much of the destruction he caused was not intentional, but rather a by-product of his own insularity.

If you dig under the facade the mainstream media presents, you will see that the Arab world hates us more than they ever did before the war.  We turned an event (9/11) for which we could have gotten tremendous support worldwide, even in the Arab world, into the most stupid debacle in the last 100 years."	\N	0	\N	0	'c1020'	't3_19643'	\N	't1_c1016'	\N	1134925483	\N	\N	1473820779	1	False	'reddit.com'	't5_6'	\N	\N	{"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1473820779,"edited":false}

'e40'	\N	\N	\N	'Women in the porn industry have had the upper hand (in terms of amount paid, compared to their male counterparts) for some time.  It follows that the balance of power and the creative control would follow them.  Thought experiment: count how many multi-millionaire male performers you can name?  I can\'t name one and have never heard mention of one.  Now the female?  Well, I can\'t remember their names, but I remember reading about them, and seeing referenes to them in various documentaries (HBO had one called something like "Sex in the Valley").  There are lots of them.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the days before the internet, the porn was controlled by a few powerful distributors, who were, yes, male (and sometimes affiliated with the mafia).  The \'net has removed the power over distribution and created a level porn playing field.\r\n\r\nSome say this exact thing is occuring right now regarding non-porn movies.  ifilm.com is certainly trying.  It\'s not clear anyone is listening, though.\r\n'	\N	0	\N	0	'c1026'	't3_19640'	\N	't3_19640'	\N	1134926754	\N	\N	1473820779	0	False	'reddit.com'	't5_6'	\N	\N	{"retrieved_on":1473820779,"edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":0}
