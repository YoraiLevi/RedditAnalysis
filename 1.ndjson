Over the years, he became so ignorant to the realities of Chinaâ\x80\x99s plight that much of the destruction he caused was not intentional, but rather a by-product of his own insularity.

How many members of the insurgency?  Or is he basing his judgements on reports from the western media (who have LESS information than the coalition\'s military leadership), and the Iraqi media in the run-up to a parliamentary election.\r\n\r\nEven if you try to be objective under these circumstances, you\'re still going to reach conclusions that support the views you already hold.
