It concisely sums up how the economic world works in a way anyone could understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept for one side argument.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me the article claims that for an economy to be successful it must let their wealth generators keep what they make.  That without this component the talented will have no incentive to create.\r\n\r\nThat may be the reason capitalism has been so successful, but are we sure our economy isn't just a local maximum?\r\n\r\nIs there really no other reason to create wealth?\r\n\r\nYou argue that without this incentive everyone's output will be reduced to the mean as it is in a big bureaucratic business.\r\n\r\nBut you also state that no-one really like working this slow and that an engineer would work their ass off on sexy projects like fighter jets.  Open source is another example that shows there has to be more incentives to a person than just building wealth.\r\n\r\nMaybe big business can't get as much out of their troops because the only incentive they can give is money.  What if they no longer needed to provide this.  What if they were forced to find something else to give their employees.  Would they be able to motivate people better than they do now?\r\n\r\nGoogle has many top producers that no longer need personal wealth and yet they still seem to be innovating.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe capitalism works so well because it's easy.  Letting people keep what they create takes relatively little infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBut, as the economy grows it seems to be getting harder.  We need more laws, more financial institutions, more cruft.  More wasted wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding the infrastructure of a central economy without corruption is a hard, risky problem.  But maybe at some point it will be cheaper than what we have now.","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_20775","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473820905,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1135357159,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"author_flair_css_class\":null,\"ups\":2,\"retrieved_on\":1473820905,\"edited\":false}"}

Other than the fact that the students would still have other classes to do and that they would be drawn from a single university, it sounds similar to SFP.  (modulo (diff Y-comb teacher)) \r\nThis would seem to be a step along the vector from normal angel investors to Y-combinator: you lower the cost of entry for the would-be entrepreneurs and give up some control.\r\nAs you lower barriers to entry into anything, you will tend to get a worse average but a better leadergroup.  Actually, that is not quite true-when you lower &lt;i&gt;uniform&lt;\/i&gt; barriers to entry, that is the case.  When nonuniform barriers to entry are lowered, the average might go up too.      The university need not give the kids enough to live on-they already have dorms, etc..  Further, the universities need not get ANY of the company to make it worth their effort-they could take 1% of the company and give it to the instructors or something as part of the terms of the class, and thus guarantee that this class had the pick of the instructors, but they have no additional cost and hence no need to profit.\r\nIf the class was given over the summer semester, then it would get REALLY cheap for the colleges-they have excess housing for the summer anyway.\r\nSo other than their cluelessness, why don't the very best colleges do their own in-house Y-combs?

The former is undoubtedly true, the latter will always be up for debate. No one can agree on the terms of the debate, though, so it will likely remain an unproductive argument.\r\n\r\nPrescod makes several unsubstantiated claims, in particular that an object is a \"better\" abstraction than a function, and that programmers do not like deeply nested expressions. The former statement strikes me as meaningless: some will program just as well with functions as others will with objects. The latter observation hints at the strange element of Lisp syntax that differentiates it from other programming languages: deeply-nested expressions.\r\n\r\n&gt; Most other languages don't have as many parentheses. Most other languages do not use prefix syntax. Glancing over a sheet of Lisp code and a sheet of Python code, what will strike you most is the difference in indentation. The Python code will have several more sections of statements at the same indentation level.\r\n\r\nPrescod claims that most programmers prefer this type of indentation. Of course, he has no data to back up this claim. I suspect that most programmers do like Python indentation more than they like Lisp indentation.

A good deal of economics and development theory and history.  A great many minds have spent a lot of time on these topics and I think overall they haven't found the answers to be as simple as Paul makes them out to be.  I am not one of these scholars so I won't make the definitive critique but I can think of a few points:\r\n\r\nFamilies need stability as well as economic growth.  Paul's formula provides no way to even try to find the right balance.\r\n\r\nA tremendous amount of wealth is created by government funded research.  Think of all the medical research and the military funding of ARPA and missile programs (and transistors).  Paul's analysis has no good way to account for that.\r\n\r\nThere is a tremendous amount of wealth being create by the free\/open source movement that cannot be accounted for by Paul's analysis.  The FOSS seems to be populated by socialist utopians from a bygone era.  Richard Stallman is a leftist of some kind and Linus Torvalds is from Finland, a &lt;i&gt;relatively&lt;\/i&gt; socialistic country.\r\n\r\nIt is not really possible to prove why the industrial revolution happened where it did.  You can make reasoned arguments, but that's not the same thing.\r\n\r\nWe need to explain why ancient Greek was able to create so much mathematics without any entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nIn the age of nuclear weapons and genetic engineering we still need to be able to rein in some kinds of research. No entrepreneur will do that.  Unless one invents something...\r\n\r\nChange introduces instability and the danger of this is neither predictable nor controllable.  There is undeniable risk.\r\n\r\nIt isn't that so much of what Paul said was wrong is that there is so much else that needs to be explained and that none of it can be proven.\r\n\r\nIt must also be said that if it were not for the entrepreneurs not only would I not have a career but I would probably not be alive.  I'm not denying the positive side -- I'm saying the analysis Paul gives is just not enough.

First of all, the only person to inherit the mark of Cain was Cain himself, and second of all, the Biblical story isn't that we are all murderers at the bottom, but rather sinners - whether that sin be greed, lust, idolatry, murder, etc.\r\n\r\n&gt; Until the twentieth century, Judeo-Christianity tended to focus on the first one; the Serpent's apple, popularly if not theologically equated with the discovery of sexuality. But as sexual taboos have lost their old forbidding force, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmark of Cain\u00e2\u0080\u009d has become relatively more important in the Judeo-Christian idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009coriginal sin\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The same churches and synagogues that blessed \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust wars\u00e2\u0080\u009d in former centuries have become strongholds of ideological pacifism.\r\n\r\nI think the only reason this is the case is not because theologically anything has changed, but rather politically the Catholic church isn't as powerful any longer and waging wars isn't in its best interest (I for the record am not a Catholic).\r\n\r\nAnd its interesting that the author says what he does, because until the 20th century, the fruit (it wasn't the Serpent's nor was it an apple), didn't really have to do with sexuality, but rather with a loss of innocence. The man and woman now were wise, and instead of simply wanting to obey God, they started worrying about the fact that they were naked, etc. The whole \"sexuality\" bit about the fruit has been a romantization of it over the past century.\r\n\r\nThe article itself seems pretty valid, it probably would've helped his case to keep inaccurate statements about Christianity out of it, though.","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_21369","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473821387,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1135535280,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"ups\":-3,\"author_flair_css_class\":null,\"retrieved_on\":1473821387,\"edited\":false}"}

It depends on what the outcome of the project is. Adolf Hitler was deloused at the expense of the state in 1908 and was effectively destitute at that time. However, he rose to great power following WWI. There wasn't a lot of procrastination as he strove towards his big project's goal. In short, there's a moral aspect to what we work on.\r\n\r\n2) \"Are you working on the most important problems in your field?\". Having spent many years in scientific research myself, I have to ask the question: \"who decides what the important problems are?\". Thomas Gold was right on the money for some problems that weren't even on the radar screens of his peers! Of course, he also had some spectacular misses; but my point is that few institutions tolerate men like Thomas Gold.\r\n\r\n3) Many artists (and I include mathematicians, scientists and business people here too), successful or otherwise, are so self absorbed with themselves I find them both boring and fairly shitty people to work with, or just to be around them. Personally see some merit in, say, someone who puts the needs of his or her children first - in effect, making them \"Project 1\". Nor do I see it as inevitable that if you do so, that you cannot also be successful in other areas of your life.\r\n\r\nThat said, I very much enjoyed Paul's essay as it put some of the main issues of procrastination into stark contast.\r\n\r\nAndrew Sheppard","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_21259","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473821389,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1135571684,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"edited\":false,\"retrieved_on\":1473821389,\"ups\":5,\"author_flair_css_class\":null}"}

However, you have to exercise care when designing macros that are used together with existing language constructs. Hidden parameters and the like break the user's expectation of Scheme's scoping mechanism, and should only be done if the alternative is way too inconvenient. If you are designing embedded DSLs using macros, the rules are totally different, of course.\r\n\r\nAlso, even if you take the macro route, it is considered good style to factor out as much as possible into functions to keep the macro definition minimal.\r\n\r\nIn your article you also mention that it's kind of inconvenient to have to specify 'yield' as a parameter to define-generator. If you are going for the baked-in feel, you can get around this by using non-hygienic macros, e.g. syntax-case macros (which most good Scheme systems support).","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_c2090","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473821391,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1135605281,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"edited\":false,\"retrieved_on\":1473821391,\"ups\":1,\"author_flair_css_class\":null}"}

The insights are almost always worth my reading. (I'm a folklorist who has begun to think and write about similar topics starting from the humanistic perspective -- the dearth of interesting work by humanists on technology is just surprising. I'm a little, okay a lot, embarrassed for the academy.)\r\n\r\nI come to reddit from reading Graham's essays -- and thanks to Slashdot for first turning me onto Graham! And I'm glad I clicked on the \"comment\" link, because I think a lot of people have raised important qualifications to Graham's schema. Most of these qualifications point out that all those B-level operations still must get done. The fallouts are: \r\n\r\n* Individuals who do only C and never B tasks in fact defer those tasks to others. This is possible in a work environment where there is a staff to handle those B tasks -- which is an interesting conundrum given Graham's argument that staff hired to handle B tasks often in fact interrupt those who work on the C tasks and hired them in the first place in order to defer the B tasks. In a home environment, B task deferment falls to a partner, whom you can only hope doesn't have C tasks of their own -- I know a lot of successful academics, mostly men, who have very (*very*) patient (and forgiving and a lot of other things) wives that tend to all the B tasks.\r\n\r\n* Individuals who only focus on C tasks, while perhaps achieving some level of greatness (and\/or recognition), are often individuals who are out of balance. They are, to put it less politely than some of the commentators here have, assholes. (Again, my experience in the academy gives me plenty of examples to call upon.) So, while we may admire their achievements, it's often the case (not always) that we also recognize that they are miserable human beings, and plenty of people choose a \"more mediocre\" life but one of relative happiness (however you want to define the latter term).\r\n\r\n* Sometimes A and B tasks are integral to getting C tasks done. As several posters put it, sometimes doing something else is a way of working on the C task you were \"supposed\" to be working on all along. Both the poet Wallace Stevens and the linguist Edward Sapir -- one an accountant and the other an insurance underwriter by occupation -- are reported to have gotten their best work done during long walks. So, C taskers who were occupied by B tasks who got their C tasks done while doing A tasks. \r\n\r\nFinally, my comment beyond my summary above is that the comments I read actually, many of which were by their own admission done as A or B level procrastination, actually made the composite essay a better one, which was one of Tim Berners-Lee's desires for the web in the first place. So my thanks to everyone for allowing me time and place to read and to think a little bit this morning while I gear up to do my own work.","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_21259","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473821391,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1135605322,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"retrieved_on\":1473821391,\"edited\":false,\"ups\":4,\"author_flair_css_class\":null}"}

While Web 2.0 is clearly a buzzword, it makes sense to analyze what the new breed of web apps have in common and is better than before. It is not just Ajax, democracy and be nice to users. One thing is he misses the APIs, but I think there is a better way to describe the difference.\r\n\r\nInitially Web was about getting something out there that the whole world can use. There is one to many relationship between your site and its users. Economically the difference from old businesses is that your front desk cost now is easily available for anyone, and its cost is pretty much constant as the users grow. Your front desk is your site.\r\n\r\nWeb 2.0 is about using the network effects in your site. The more your site is used, the more beneficial it is for its users. Your site is not just a connection between you and your users, it is many-to-many connection between your users. \r\n\r\nIt is a lot like bringing network effects like the ones we know from instant messaging on a new platform - the Web. Why is the Web suitable for this? Because there are already acccumulated solid and general mechanisms that make the web work, and you can plug in yours more easily. If you use things like RSS, REST, JSON, etc it is also easier for others to plug in to you. This is how mashups come into play.\r\n\r\nThis is a lot like a preexposed and generalized democracy component. Being nice to users is necessary in the context of democracy, because in such environment minor usability enhancements have compound effect to the bottom line: that's why Ajax is necessary. Now that extra effort to make the site a little more useful is actually worth it. You need to enable users to be effective in your democracy, because this affects the bottom line. You need to be easily reachable, which accounts for APIs, bookmarklets, backlink tracking etc.\r\n\r\nBut I think democracy is a misnomer: political democracy is about voting, and have the majority win. Minority doesn't get what it wants. It is quite a different mechanism that works with The Long Tail: everyone should get what is suitable for him. Most Web 2.0 applications are not quite there, but clearly this is the trend.\r\n\r\nP.S: It is an interesting thought experiment to imagine implementing a Long Tail kind of democracy politically. Neal Stephenson envisions a world of small districts with radically different laws in \"Snow Crash\".

Based on the comments I've read above mine, I think this must be the most content-rich web discussion forum I've ever encountered!  What is the reddit secret?  Why so many more smart participants than, say, slashdot?\r\n\r\nanyway.  I'd just like to add that I've been reading Paul's essays for years now, and they've almost all been uniformly great. I can't even remember where I first encountered him.  I sent him an e-mail a few months ago, and he answered it, even though I'm sure he gets hundreds of e-mails per day.  I've been trying to think up a second e-mail topic that might be interesting enough to garner another reply, but I haven't yet.\r\n\r\nThose of you talking about exceptions to his putting-off-errands message are, perhaps, missing relevant experience to understand what he's talking about.  Someone said he had to put off A tasks such as interviewing programmers, for example, to do B-level errands.  I'm pretty sure that's not what Paul is talking about.\r\n\r\nThere are some types of work that are almost infinitely hard.  You can only work on such problems in long, uninterrupted stretches of time, and only when properly inspired.  Certain types of computer programming are that hard for me.  If I found myself in a mood to tackle one of those hard problems, then yeah, I would absolutely put off laundry, changing the oil in my car, paying the bills, or anything else to put the work behind me.  If your field doesn't require that sort of work from you, I guess I envy you a little bit, because it's really draining.  If so, you are perhaps not someone that Paul's essay applies to.\r\n\r\nIf you guys like Paul Graham, you're also liable to like John McCarthy, the inventor of lisp.  I recently ran across this story he wrote which I found very enlightening, \"The Robot and the Baby.\"\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www-formal.stanford.edu\/jmc\/robotandbaby.html\r\n\r\nTruly excellent in all technical aspects, but it also demonstrates that understanding human beings is perhaps not McCarthy's strong suit.

If you pay for membership at a store, like at a Sam's Club or a Costco, they can make \"must stop at door for receipt inspection\" a condition of membership. That's about it.\r\n\r\nA store anyone can shop at can't stop you at the door to check your receipt. They can ask you to stop, but they can't actually physically stop you.\r\n\r\nI agree completely with the author's position -- if I pay for something, I'm done. I have no need for security cronies following me demanding I prove I've paid for it. \"Guilty until innocent\" doesn't fly with me. Prove I stole something from you.\r\n\r\nHad I been in a similar position, the moment brute force (or the threat of such) was used to physically stop me from leaving, I'd have offered a single warning to move away from me and clear my vehicle's path (inviting them to record my license plate but warning that a car weighs a *lot* more than a human). Then, if they'd refused, I'd have called the police myself, and pushed as hard as I could to have charges filed against everyone involved.\r\n\r\nIf this really happened the way the author describes, the security minions at the store had already made so many mistakes in their handling of the situation that even if he *had* stolen the stuff, they'd have had major trouble getting charges to stick. It's fine to follow the guy out to his car to ask him to return to the store. Everything that happened afterwards *isn't*. Using your body to prevent a person from entering their car to leave is a form of detainment (unlawful at that). Using your body to block the vehicle's departure is similarly detainment.\r\n\r\nThe author really should have involved the police as soon as he saw the situation escalating. I, too, have shopped at stores that want to inspect my receipt at the exit. I've thanked them for their interest and walked past them without \"presenting my papers\" every single time. We do not (yet) live in a society where we're guilty until we prove we're not, and I refuse to submit to little power trips like that.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, you can still return something to a store that \"marks\" receipts they inspect at the door even without the little \"inspection mark.\"\r\n\r\nThis probably sounds nasty, but here's the bottom line: shoplifting and theft at stores like this is *not* my problem. I am not part of the problem, and I am not going to be a willing participant in your solution. If your inventory system is so broken that you really *do* have to count stuff sold as it goes out the door, upgrade your inventory system. If you have a rampant shoplifting problem, take effective steps to make identification and prosecution of thieves easier. You discourage theft by making it unprofitable and personally destructive to the thieves, not by inconveniencing and annoying your customers.\r\n\r\nHassling people at the door is almost *never* successful and usually at least annoys people (and in this case, it was much worse), and when you try it with someone who actually knows their rights, you get incidents like this. While those goons were chasing after a paying customer, countless others walked out the front doors without a glance from the \"security\" guy who's supposed to be pouncing people at the door for their receipts. You can't show whether that let another thief out the door, but the customer the goons chased down turned right back around, and whipped out that receipt not for \"proof of purchase\" but for \"I want a refund, *now*\" purposes.\r\n\r\nThe store lost a sale because of its behavior *after* it'd made the sale and the customer was *out the door*.

You're going to back \"Java's cover\" by citing an article written in BusinessWeek? (Clearly BW is an authority on programming languages.)

Speaking of which, did you notice these facts in the article:\r\n\r\n\"In North America, the percentage of developers who use Java as one of their principal programming languages declined to 47.9 in Evans' fall survey.\"\r\n\r\n\"IBM stands by its commitment to Java.

Hey, more freedom for everyone, I say. (blatant disclaimer)\r\n\r\nBut just some notes for discussion:\r\n\r\n2) I think that hanging around people who are openly gay makes people more likely to act gay. People tend to act like their peers. I understand there is a strong political motivation against statements like that, but sexuality is such a social and physiologically complex thing --more complex than a simple yes\/no physical trait. It seems somehow demeaning, and at best, dishonest, to claim otherwise. I think we can all reasonably agree that social behavior is influenced by our social interactions. That sounds obvious to me.\r\n\r\nSimply, acceptable behavior is more expressed. Plus, sexuality doesn't seem to be a clean straight\/gay division, so I think that a more homosexual-friendly society would give borderline people more options. That is, instead of only being willing to have straight relationships, they would be free to have homosexual ones, too. How is that unreasonable?\r\n\r\n3) Marrying a dog or a child or a car is absurd. But this still opens some interesting \"why not\" questions (for me at least, I'm a comp sci guy, not a law guy). If marriage is whatever consenting adults agree to, why not polygamy? Why not an 80 year old and a 20 year old (legal but frowned on). Why not a \"year free trial\" clause? Or a marriage subscription that must be renewed every 90 days? Why not?

An attempt to make the work as watertight as possible, against rebukes for not having performed other tasks, a sort of overcompensation.

C is a fairly bad assembler, as can be testified by anyone who has compiled basicly any functional language to C.  It is fairly hard to support multiple-value-return, continuations are a bit of a bear, and fast function call interfaces such as those used by Ocaml are not possible (at least, not portably).  For something to be an assembler, you would want to be able to get at the stack, which you cannot do (directly) in C.  Java is even worse as an assembler, and it gets used as an assembler sometimes.  I dearly hope that it does not become the de facto standard assembly the way C has.  It limits implementors in much the same way that semantically poor languages limit the programmer, and limiting the implementors hurts all of us.\r\nAs to low-level teaching languages, perhaps it would be useful to have a teaching architecture, like MMIX or the apple II or the amiga-all of them are probably understandable by a single person, and they are all a lot simpler than most current chips.

(I happen to agree with the consensus within the comments that this is not one of them, but that's beside the point).","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_c2469","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473821483,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1135935730,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"edited\":false,\"retrieved_on\":1473821483,\"ups\":3,\"author_flair_css_class\":null}"}

Date, and thereby hope I differentiate myself from most of todays CS Grads.\"\r\n\r\nIf you program in Java, you had damn well better understand pointers. Or rather, you had better understand Java's references, which are safer than C-style pointers but which still have the same potential for problems with referential transparency and weird side-effect mazes. This is important in almost all languages; you can only truly escape it if you use a purely functional language like Haskell, and then only if you don't use the special syntax for imitating side-effects with state-transition monads.\r\n\r\n\"But I program in Java, and there are some \"weedout\" concepts, interfaces being the one that first springs to mind. I once heard interfaces called \"architecture enablers\" and maybe that is the difference between Java and the previous languages that were taught in CS courses.\"\r\n\r\nYou think that interfaces are a difficult concept to grasp? They just reflect the common OO practice of making similar objects support the same methods for certain purposes. They're not even the best way of doing it; why doesn't Java allow you to specify that some variable must implement *multiple* interfaces? Haskell's type classes, which are very similar to interfaces, allow this, so it can't be too difficult to type-check, and the syntax wouldn't be too hard to understand.\r\n\r\n\"Not having to worry about pointers allows one to more quickly get to the point of being able to 'architect' a solution.\"\r\n\r\nGuess what? SICP, which uses Scheme as a teaching language, doesn't get to anything even vaguely pointer-like until chapter 3---and there are only 5 chapters. There are plenty of other languages which have less pointer crap to worry about than Java, and are easier to learn too, so students can get into the difficult concepts faster instead of dinking around with the syntax of a for loop.\r\n\r\nYour ignorance is showing, and you don't seem to realize it. Please, learn Scheme and ML. It should be an eye-opening experience for you.\r\n\r\n\"Just be sure you hire Java programmers who grok interfaces, and for heavens sake stay away from PHP coders!\"\r\n\r\nAny Java programmer who doesn't even understand such a simple concept as interfaces shouldn't be hired, I agree. However, I fail to see the problem with PHP coders. If someone knows *only* PHP, of course they should probably be avoided, but PHP is a decent language for certain things.

Make of that what you will, but it is not the sort of success that Graham is talking about.","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_c2372","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473821498,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1135966337,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"retrieved_on\":1473821498,\"edited\":false,\"ups\":2,\"author_flair_css_class\":null}"}

I didn't try to claim that Java is the _best_ language for software engineering; I'm arguing that it has properties that make large codebases easier to manage, hence a better vehicle for teaching software engineering.\r\n\r\nYes, functions reuse code, and every language has some idea of a function, subroutine, method, what have you, but I think that the standard library that comes with Java has much more to offer than what you get with other languages. You'll notice that it is quite consistent in terms of naming conventions and other things, which is impressive for a library of its size. This is code reuse on a larger scale than we see in other languages.\r\n\r\nAnother property that helps with managing large codebases is namespaces. Without namespaces, it is difficult to produce a large codebase and be certain that there won't be naming collisions if you need to make it work with another large codebase (suppose your software company acquires another one, for example -- again, this isn't a problem that you and your buddies face when hacking together -- I'm talking about something on a larger scale than that).\r\n\r\nI concede that the REPL is a huge tool, which is why I use the DrJava plugin for Eclipse when I use Java. I hate the name, but it allows me to execute Java statements and try things out without creating a throwaway class with a main() method. ([shamelessPlug]If you're a JavaScript hacker, then you may want to check out my Chickenfoot extension for Firefox, which offers something of a REPL for JavaScript, plus a lot more[\/shamelessPlug].)\r\n\r\nThe tools for refactoring in Java have become very good (as I said, I use Eclipse), which is also important when it comes to managing large codebases. In most languages, if you want to rename a variable in your code, then you run perl minus pie to rename it everywhere, cross your fingers, and hope that you didn't break anything. With tools like Eclipse, you can do that renaming such that you know that you haven't changed the behavior of your program. (Renaming a variable may be a weak example, extracting methods\/interfaces are more compelling refactorings that Eclipse can do, but it's not as clear what the analogue is in some other languages, which is why I used the renaming example.)\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that such refactoring tools could not exist in other languages (in particular, functional programming languages), but I haven't seen them yet. Because Java is a bit of a control freak (to the dismay of \"Real Hackers\"), creating such tools is easier to do for Java. There is certainly a fair bit of research going on to make analogous tools in other languages, but until they come to fruition, I think that teaching Java with Eclipse is a better way to teach software engineering.\r\n\r\nI was a TA for 6.170 for three semesters at MIT, and I started the movement from Emacs to Eclipse. Since Eclipse made it so easy to run unit tests and interact with CVS, which I think are also important practices for a software developer, I thought it was clearly the way to go. As you can imagine, some students\/faculty thought otherwise, but that's a whole different discussion.*\r\n\r\n*For the record, no student (or faculty member :) was forced to use Eclipse in 6.170: students have always been free to use whatever tools they want. You can bet that we had, and will continue to have, die-hards who insist on using Emacs and checking in their code from the command line. I've forgotten the -kb flag enough times to convince me that it isn't the way to go, but that's just my opinion.","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_c2599","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473821499,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1135972023,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"retrieved_on\":1473821499,\"edited\":false,\"ups\":9,\"author_flair_css_class\":null}"}

Such variety would be a nightmare for our automated test suite and the other tools we use to help with grading (which are written in Python, incidentally).\r\n\r\nI don't know what you mean by \"x,\" but I believe that the last language that was used for 6.170 was CLU, which is a language that was invented at MIT. It was one of the first (if not the first) languages to focus on data abstraction and I'm told it had nice iterators and exception handling, so I suppose this was a good choice for 6.170 back in the day. My best guess as to why they switched to Java (in the late 90s, I believe) is that it looked like Java was going somewhere and CLU wasn't (which certainly turned out to be true). Because of the switch, students have been able to make some fantastic final projects since they can leverage third-party libraries written in Java, such as OpenGL, which is a lot more fun than doing a project without such libraries. I also think it's important that there is at least one course in the CS curriculum that exposes students to tools that people use in the real world (CVS, Eclipse) as opposed to tools that were made for and by MIT (Edwin the Scheme editor).","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t1_c2621","subreddit_id":"t5_6","author_created_utc":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","approved_at_utc":null,"retrieved_utc":1473821501,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1136043341,"gilded":0,"name":null,"json":"{\"retrieved_on\":1473821501,\"edited\":false,\"ups\":5,\"author_flair_css_class\":null}"}
